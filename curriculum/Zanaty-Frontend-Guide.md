## Mohammed ElZanaty Frontend Guide

I’m a self-taught engineer and have now guided several friends to learn to react as well as React is a high-demand, high-paying skill.

here are the courses I took until today, it might help anyone to start:- 

## Learning fundamentatls

## Learning Javascript  
> After the above courses I thought that I understand frontend well which later I understand that I know nothing and I found myself stuggling in buiding stuff with javascript so I back to learn it again with the below resouces 

Let me share with you how I learn JavaScript and believe me, I have worked with it for more than two years without understanding why? so now if you feel panic from js interviews and js tasks so you are in the right place ... Look, you don’t need to know what a function, variables, for loop or even anything for basic, I trust you have learned [js basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803) before or you already know JavaScript enough to build a simple JavaScript-only web application. **While the 12 concepts noted below are neither complex nor difficult but believe me every modern JavaScript developer should know well you will understand them best if you already know at least some basic JavaScript.**

At this stage, I feel that I know that I understand a lot of concepts but, to be honest with my friend, still can't build anything so I realize that I just know theory stuff. this does not satisfy my cravings and my constant feeling that I know Javascript and still am not satisfied so now we need to get our hands dirty and this happens with 2 phenomenal resources

### Get your Hands Dirty

1. As Wes said: This is [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) — let's build 30 things together. this one of the core steps on my path it help me to understand more and build the first brick in my portfolio
2. [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) by freeCodeCamp will give a solid background for how to solve a problem and how to search as most of the exercise you will not be able to solve it from first time or at least that what happened to me.

if you reach here and still reading my awesome article so it's time to dig deeper in js and this will happen by reading not watching

### Reading Time

1. [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) **by** Marijn Haverbeke. this book really helps me to know the fact that I still know nothing 😂 so it's good to read it.
2. [**You-Don't-Know-JS**](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) **by** Kyle Simpson, I read the first two chapters it's good, to be honest, but I feel more comfortable at Eloquent JS book

### Good Reference when you search

1. [javascript-info](https://javascript.info/)
2. [MDN Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

If you reach this point, you will feel that you are js ninja so you will apply to jobs and surprisingly you will get refused 😂😂😂 because js interview question is different and you are كحيان so the question now how I pass the interview is there's anything else I need to review.

**_YES_**

here are the resources you need to learn before an interview

1. [Practical Question](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions)
2. [Frequently Asked JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers for Freshers and Experienced](https://www.guru99.com/javascript-interview-questions-answers.html)
3. [70 JavaScript Interview Questions](https://dev.to/macmacky/70-javascript-interview-questions-5gfi)

## Git 

1. [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github)
2. [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

## React 

1. [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
2. [The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/)
3. [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/)
